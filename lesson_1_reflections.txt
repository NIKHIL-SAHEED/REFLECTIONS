diff showed the difference btwn old and new file
its good since only changed line are visble 
makes us easier to find the difference in projects
some have history in it like google doc shows when and who has made a change in the files
commit
its is good to commit manually
so we decide when and where to commit
commits shoud not be too long or short
if too long we have to keep searching in big codes
also early commits increases the number of coding changes
it is allways bttr to commit a project aftr a logical change
no 2 bug fix should be commited togather
all same typo should be commited togather
git allows saving multiple document in 1 commit because
in git the files are commited togatherly
and there might me files that are linked to each other
where as in google doc files are separate from each other 
the donot have linked files so commits single documents
and only can change the codes in a single document
git log and git diff
git log shows all commits and git diff shows the commits btwn different version of the file
using version control to commit helps a lot
git log would give all the commits made
from which previos versions can be checked using git checkout
and  versions details can be compared using git diff
