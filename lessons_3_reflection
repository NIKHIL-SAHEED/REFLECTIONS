new file has been addde to github directly
for remote to stay uptodate it must be diificylt cuz there might be lot of people working on git hub
and we just want to pull the details that are required
branch occurs when the same repository has to go new commits in other ways rather than master
clone is copying the whole repository from github to system or system to system
forking is directly getting the repository via git hub
having last stored locally can have a real copy and others can work on different copies
and whn combined all copies can be compared to the one stored locally which dose not change
