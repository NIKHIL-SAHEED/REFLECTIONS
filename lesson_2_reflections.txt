when i initialize a repository the files on that folder 
are being tracked by the git repository
staging area is where we could add things before we commit
it also shows status aftr init it is on staging area which is a part of git
git add and git status operates on staging area 
stats works both on staging area and working directory
the working area staging and repository
reposity contains last commit
whn a new change is made it reflects in working area
staging area has last commit now without the change made now
git diff shows the diff in wa and sa
git add filenAME Adds the new changes to stagin are
git diff --staged gives the changes in last commit and stage area
git commit creates anew commits in the repository
git branch
it hels to alternativey edit the file
like for creating an experimental 
oe to create a alternate langauge version 
so that the main file is not messed up
diagram helps to get to branches  
some changes are branched from master and there may be few changes that are not reachable
so graphical diagrams shows all the branches
git merge f1 f2 merges to branches that merges f2 in f1 comparing whith the common parent branch
git manual merge allows us to keep all the changes that we want and we could declare which change is effective
as git could not effectively determine th effective way
